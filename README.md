Test conducted on the 17/04/2024, Summary
so summary for myself : 
morecompany's version offset causes an immediate connection rejection before my postfix can even run, this needs to be fixed
without morecompany, my postfix rejection/approval works, with users being rejected if they are not in list and users being able to join if they are.
next step : morecompany compatability, add steam ids while in game and stuff
