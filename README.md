# HoloCheck

A mod that allows for the user to protect their public lobbies with either a password, or a whitelist. This allows for creation of lobbies without Steam friending/invites, while still ensuring only your approved group enters!

Password Protection works on manipulating Version Numbers and comparing with clients attempting to join.
Alternatively, password protection can be set to work on injecting the password into the connectionRequest payload. 
Whitelist works on comparing steamIDs with a collected list.
