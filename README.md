# Branch namedMethods
Aim : Develop a non-version numbering method of synchronizing and checking passkeys
Utilise Custom Messages at the same time as when mods would normally sync configs, to determine whether to terminate the connections?
Investigate if there is an alternate way to transmit a message at the same time as the initial connection payload, or if LC performs additional checks that we can inject code into. 

# HoloCheck

A mod that allows for the user to protect their public lobbies with either a password, or a whitelist. This allows for creation of lobbies without Steam friending/invites, while still ensuring only your approved group enters!

Password Protection works on manipulating Version Numbers and comparing with clients attempting to join.
Whitelist works on comparing steamIDs with a collected list.
